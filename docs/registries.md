# Docker Registry & Helm Repository

SolaKube supports deploying 2 types of Docker image registries on the K8s cluster (Docker Registry, JFrog Container Registry).
 
It also allows configuring a default/shared private registry or a per-application private registry for applications that need it [see the relevant section](Configuring a private registry for applications).   


# Registry Considerations

## Docker registry types (internal/external, public/private)

In most non-trivial, production-grade Kubernetes clusters there is a private Docker registry that allows for higher self-containment, better resiliency to external changes and faster Docker image pulls compared to pulling images from external registries.

If the cluster contains internally developed applications, it is often a requirement that the Docker images of the application are NOT published in public registries like Docker HUB but only in some private registry.

In a lot of organizations the production environments are firewalled (air-gapped) from the internet and the cluster doesn't have access to external Docker registries. This requires that you have a private registry inside the internal network of the organization. 

If the private registry is part of the cluster (an internal registry), that makes the cluster more self-contained and resilient. Also, it becomes possible to better calculate the load on the registry, if it is not shared among several clusters. (A drawback may be some extra resource consumption for storage and CPU for operations like vulnerability scans)

In case of a cluster-internal registry you push all Docker images (used by the cluster) into the internal registry and the images are distributed among the nodes from there. In case your cluster is dynamic and workloads get rescheduled between nodes often, image pulls will be much faster from the internal registry than from external sources.

Even if the original binaries and sources of the application are lost and the container is removed from its original distribution registry (Docker HUB), your cluster can still operate without issues with an internal registry. This may not happen often but it DOES appen from time-to-time and it is impossible to solve without a private registry.  

Internal registries may be cleaned and pruned very efficiently because you may only need to keep those docker images that have active deployments (using delays, allowing for quick rollbacks after deployment of buggy deployments)

The content of an internal registry is usually backed up like any other persistent data on your cluster, so you can migrate all of your Docker images together with your normal data and recreate your cluster practically anywhere.

## Helm repositories

Helm repositories are similar to Docker registries in purpose, only they contain Helm charts instead of Docker images.

Helm charts are needed only when you first install or update an application, as opposed to Docker images which are needed any time a workload is (re)scheduled on a cluster node.

Helm charts may also be managed in private Git repositories and charts downloaded to the deployer machine when needed. Not as elegant as a full-blown Helm chart registry but workable.   

Due to this, having a private Helm registry is less important than an internal Docker registry.

# Supported registries

## Docker Registry (simple)

SolaKube supports the deployment of the bare-bone Docker Registry released by Docker itself.

This only supports Docker images (no Helm chart support), has no user interface at all and doesn't have full-blown access control. However, it also has modest default resource needs in terms of memory and CPU so it is eminently suitable for small clusters with a small number of private images.  

Details in the [Docker Registry](docker-registry.md) page.

## JFrog Container Registry (JCR)

This is a full blown Docker image and Helm chart registry with proper access control (e.g.: LDAP authentication). However, its resource use is much-much higher. Doesn't have built-in vulnerability scanning, requires a paid component (XRay) for it.

As of version 7.6.3, JCR requires a minimum of 1,5 GB of RAM to be allocated (default Helm chart install, no tuning) even for starting up. The official recommendation for their "small" system scenario is minimum 4 GB of RAM. This is not ideal for smaller clusters (IOT, enthusiasts...etc). 

SolaKube provides a deployer (jcr) for this registry but this should be considered alpha level as of now. 

Some of the issues:

- resource requests/limits need to be configured manually
- memory usage may be possible to reduce, since this is a Java application and by default, the Helm chart does not seem to provide it with any proper heap settings

WARNING: Future SolaKube efforts will probably center on Harbor. 

# Notes on other registries

## Harbor

Full blown Docker/Helm registry like JCR but fully open-source and managed by the CNCF.

Has LDAP integration and vulnerability scanning.

It seems to require as much resources as JCR but this should still be preferred over JCR due to its OSS nature, feature set and activity around it.

NOTE: In SolaKube this seems to make more sense than JCR.

## Portus

Exclusively a Docker image registry but has LDAP integration and built-in vulnerability scanning.

Looks to require much less resources than Harbor/JCR/Nexus. Default beta Helm chart values recommend ~ 2GB of RAM (adding up all components). 

Currently, it doesn't have a stable Helm chart. There used to be a beta chart in incubator but it has been removed. It seems to have very little activity around it.

## Nexus 3 OSS

Besides being able to serve as a Docker image registry, Nexus supports many artifact repository types (e.g.: Maven).

It is very heavy on resources, requires minimum 4 CPU cores and 8 GB RAM [according to the documentation](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/installation/system-requirements#SystemRequirements-CPU).


# Configuring a private registry for applications

SolaKube allows configuring a default/shared private registry or a per-application private registry for applications that need it [see the relevant section](#Application specific registry).   

# The default private registry

If more than one of your application will use a private registry, the DEFAULT registry can be defined with the following variables:

~~~
# Hostname and port of the registry service
export DEFAULT_PRIVATE_REGISTRY_FQN=""

# Username for the registry access
export DEFAULT_PRIVATE_REGISTRY_USERNAME=""

# Password for the username for the registry access
export DEFAULT_PRIVATE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=""
~~~ 

# Application specific registry

If the DEFAULT registry is not suitable for the application, an application-specific registry can be defined (in the sample, the app is 'APP1' ) :

~~~
# Hostname and port of the registry service
export APP1_PRIVATE_REGISTRY_FQN=""

# Username for the registry access
export APP1_PRIVATE_REGISTRY_USERNAME=""

# Password for the username for the registry access
export APP1_PRIVATE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=""
~~~

NOTE: The SolaKube deployer of the application must also be able to detect the registry variables (ensureRegistryAccessForApp method) and pass them into the Helm chart values file (or whatever it uses as deploy mechanism). Currently, this is not implemented in most deployers (see below).

# Preparing an application deployer for using a private registry

ATM, most SolaKube application deployers do not support private registries since the images are supposed to come from Docker Hub.

When a private registry is needed:

## ensuring the derived variables and the registry secret

The deployer script needs to include the method call that ensures that the necessary secret is deployed in the application's namespace (that contains the access credentials of the private registry for Kubernetes):

~~~
# Ensuring private registry access params
ensureRegistryAccessForApp "${XYZ_APP_NAME}"
~~~

NOTE: typically the ${XYZ_APP_NAME} is also the name of the namespace of the application by deployer convention (e.g.: "nextcloud").

This will also define the following, derived variables from the DEFAULT or application-specific variables:

- PRIVATE_REGISTRY_FQN
- PRIVATE_REGISTRY_USERNAME
- PRIVATE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD 
   
## Referencing the private registry in deployment descriptors

The application deployment files need to be able to reference the PRIVATE_REGISTRY_FQN variable defined by SolaKube.

If the deployer uses a Helm chart, the Helm chart values must contain the reference to the private registry.

It will be something similar to this:

~~~
frontend:
    # image: awesome-app:8.4.6
    registry: ${PRIVATE_REGISTRY_FQN}
~~~

Typically, the chart-values.yaml file of the application must be modified to include the reference. See the chart's documentation how to provide the private registry.

NOTE: Sometimes the Helm chart is capable of creating the private registry secret as well. In this case, it also accepts the PRIVATE_REGISTRY_USERNAME and PRIVATE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD in a chart variable and "ensureRegistryAccessForApp" is not necessary.
